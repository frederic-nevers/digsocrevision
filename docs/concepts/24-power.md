The dominance of tech giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple (GAFA) exemplifies the concentration of power in the digital economy. These companies have amassed vast amounts of data, wealth, and influence through their control of key digital platforms and infrastructures, such as search engines, e-commerce marketplaces, social networks, and mobile operating systems. The power of [GAFA](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/18/technology/free-ad-instagram-facebook-snapchat.html) has raised concerns about monopolistic practices, data privacy, and the erosion of democratic institutions. At the same time, the rise of decentralized technologies like [blockchain](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/blockchain-explained/) and [cryptocurrencies](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/technology/sam-bankman-fried-crypto-blockchain.html) has offered alternative visions of power distribution and governance in the digital world. The example of GAFA illustrates the complex interplay of corporate, governmental, and grassroots power in shaping the digital landscape.

## Notes

### 2.4A: Power as a feature of social relations
   - 💬 **Influence**: The ability to shape the opinions, behaviors, or decisions of others (e.g., [social media influencers](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/technology/influencer-social-media-culture.html), [online opinion leaders](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/07/07/the-rise-of-the-micro-influencer-in-a-post-pandemic-world/?sh=4ba22e1a1cf6))
   - 🔒 **Control**: The capacity to dictate or restrict the actions or choices of others (e.g., [platform moderation policies](https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/), [digital surveillance systems](https://www.eff.org/issues/mass-surveillance-technologies))

<details>
  <summary>🧠 How is power embedded or exercised through a specific digital system, technology or platform?</summary>
- 📈 Algorithmic curation and recommendation systems that shape user attention and preferences
- 📊 Data collection and analysis that enables targeted advertising, profiling, and manipulation
- 📜 Platform policies and design choices that govern user behavior and expression

   - 👩‍💼 **Organizations**: Groups of people with shared goals, resources, and structures (e.g., [tech companies](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/tech-giants-big-tech-trillion-dollar-companies/), [digital rights advocacy groups](https://www.eff.org/))
   - ⚖️ **Governments**: The systems and apparatus of the state that create and enforce laws, policies, and regulations (e.g., [national digital strategies](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/countries-digitisation-governance), [internet governance frameworks](https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/))
