## üìù Notes

### Types of Computers
- **Mainframe**: Large, powerful computers used for high-volume data processing and critical applications.
- **Server**: Computers that provide resources, data, or services to other computers over a network.
- **Personal Computer**: 
  - Desktop: Stationary computers designed for use at a desk.
  - Laptop: Portable computers that can be used on the go.
- **Tablet**: Mobile devices with touchscreens, larger than smartphones but smaller than laptops.
- **Smart/Mobile Device**: Smartphones and other handheld devices with advanced computing capabilities.
- **Wearable Computers and Devices**: Computing devices worn on the body, such as smartwatches or fitness trackers.

### Components of a Computer
- **Hardware**: Physical components of a computer system.
  - **Motherboard**: The main circuit board that connects all components.
  - **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: The "brain" of the computer that executes instructions.
  - **Memory**: Temporary storage for data and instructions currently in use.
    - RAM (Random Access Memory): Fast, volatile memory that loses data when power is lost.
    - ROM (Read-Only Memory): Non-volatile memory that retains data even without power.
  - **Storage**: Permanent storage for data and programs.
    - HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Traditional mechanical storage using spinning disks.
    - SSD (Solid State Drive): Faster, more durable storage using flash memory.
  - **Graphics and Sound Components**: Hardware responsible for processing and outputting visual and audio data.
  - **Power Supply**: Provides electrical power to all components.
  - **Input and Output Devices**: Peripherals used for interacting with the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer).
  - **Sensors**: Devices that detect and respond to physical stimuli (e.g., temperature, light, motion).
- **Interfaces**: Methods of interaction between users, computers, and other devices.
  - **User Interfaces**: The means by which users interact with a computer system.
    - Command Line: Text-based interface where users enter commands.
    - Graphic: Visual interface using icons, windows, and menus (e.g., GUI - Graphical User Interface).
    - Haptic: Interface that provides tactile feedback (e.g., vibrations, force feedback).
- **Software**: Programs and instructions that control computer operations.
  - **Operating System Software**: Software that manages computer hardware, software, and provides common services (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - **Software Applications, Apps**: Programs designed for specific tasks (e.g., word processors, web browsers, mobile apps).
  - **Malicious Software**: Software intended to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems (e.g., viruses, malware, trojans).

### Uses and Forms of Computer Coding
- **Computer Coding and Programming**: Writing instructions in a programming language to create software.
- **Specific Languages and Rules**: Different programming languages have their own syntax and conventions (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- **Communicating Instructions to Computers**: Coding translates human-readable instructions into machine-readable form.

### Evolution of Computing
- **Generations in Computing**: 
  - First generation: Vacuum tubes, machine language, large and expensive.
  - Second generation: Transistors, assembly language, smaller and more reliable.
  - Third generation: Integrated circuits, high-level programming languages, increased speed and efficiency.
  - Fourth generation: Microprocessors, graphical user interfaces, personal computers.
  - Fifth generation: Artificial intelligence, natural language processing, advanced robotics.
- **Moore's Law**: The observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power.
- **Emerging Areas of Computing**: 
  - **Quantum Computing**: Harnessing quantum mechanics to perform complex computations, potentially solving problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers.
