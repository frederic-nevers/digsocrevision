# üåç Drowning in E-waste? üóëÔ∏è

Technology can be both beneficial and detrimental to the environment. It can offer innovative solutions to environmental challenges, but also contribute to environmental degradation through electronic waste and energy consumption. A holistic approach that considers the entire life cycle of technology products and services is necessary for striking a balance between sustainability and technological advancement.

## üåü The Big Ideas üåü

- The potential of technology to develop innovative solutions to environmental challenges
- The contribution of technology to environmental degradation through e-waste and energy consumption
- The importance of striking a balance between the benefits and negative impacts of technology on the environment
- The need for a holistic approach considering the entire life cycle of technology products and services
- The social and economic implications of technological advances in relation to environmental sustainability

## ‚ùì Inquiry Questions ‚ùì

### Content-based
<details>
<summary>üíª What are the main components of a computer system, and how do they work together to process and store data?</summary>

- The main components of a computer system include the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM and ROM), storage devices (hard drive, SSD), input devices (keyboard, mouse), and output devices (monitor, printer)
- The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for processing instructions and performing calculations
- Memory (RAM) is used to temporarily store data and instructions that the CPU is currently working with, while ROM stores the basic instructions needed to start up the computer
- Storage devices like hard drives and SSDs provide long-term storage for data and programs, even when the computer is turned off
- Input devices allow users to enter data and commands into the computer, while output devices display or print the results of the computer's processing

<summary>üìà How has computer hardware evolved over time, and what key technological advancements have driven this evolution?</summary>

- Early computers in the 1940s and 1950s were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes and punched cards for processing and storage
- The invention of the transistor in 1947 paved the way for smaller, faster, and more reliable computers, leading to the development of integrated circuits and microprocessors in the 1960s and 1970s
- The introduction of personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Apple II and IBM PC, made computing more accessible and affordable for individual users
- The development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and the mouse in the 1980s made computers more user-friendly and intuitive to use
- Advancements in storage technology, such as the introduction of the hard disk drive and later solid-state drives (SSDs), have greatly increased the storage capacity and speed of computers
- The rise of mobile computing and the internet in the 1990s and 2000s has led to the development of smaller, more powerful devices like laptops, smartphones, and tablets, as well as cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT)

<summary>üñ•Ô∏è What is the role of the central processing unit (CPU), input and output devices in a computer?</summary>

- The CPU is the central processing unit of a computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations
- It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them, performing arithmetic and logical operations on data
- Input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and touchscreens, allow users to enter data and commands into the computer
- They convert physical actions (like keystrokes or mouse clicks) into digital signals that the computer can process
- Output devices, such as monitors and printers, display or print the results of the computer's processing
- Monitors use pixels to display text, images, and video, while printers use ink or toner to create physical copies of digital documents
- Together, the CPU, input devices, and output devices form the core components of a computer system, allowing users to enter and manipulate data, and see the results of their work

### Concept-based
<details>
<summary>üåç How do factors such as technology obsolescence, changing consumer preferences, and market saturation impact the product life cycle for tech products?</summary>

- Technology obsolescence, driven by rapid advancements and the introduction of new features and capabilities, can shorten the useful life of tech products and encourage premature replacement
- Changing consumer preferences, such as the desire for the latest and greatest devices or the adoption of new technology standards, can also contribute to the early disposal of functional products
- Market saturation, where a high percentage of the target market already owns a particular type of device, can lead to increased competition and pressure to innovate, further accelerating product turnover
- These factors can lead to a "throwaway culture" where devices are seen as disposable rather than durable, contributing to the growing e-waste problem

</details>

### Debatable
<details>
<summary>ü§î Is technology a net positive or negative for the environment, and how can we ensure that technological advances are used in ways that promote sustainability and protect natural resources for future generations?</summary>

- Technology has the potential to create more efficient and sustainable processes, such as renewable energy systems, smart grids, and precision agriculture, which can help reduce environmental impacts
- However, the production, use, and disposal of technology products also contribute to environmental problems, such as resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and e-waste
- The rapid pace of technological change and the increasing demand for technology products can exacerbate these negative impacts, as devices become obsolete more quickly and are replaced more frequently
- To ensure that technology advances are used in ways that promote sustainability, we need to consider the entire life cycle of products, from raw material extraction to end-of-life disposal, and develop circular economy approaches that prioritize reuse, repair, and recycling
- We also need to invest in research and development of clean technologies, create incentives for sustainable innovation, and promote responsible consumption and production practices

</details>

<details>
<summary>üß† TOK CONNECTION: Who should be responsible for addressing the growing problem of e-waste: governments, manufacturers, consumers, or some combination of all three, and how can we ensure that e-waste is disposed of responsibly and sustainably?</summary>

- Governments have a role to play in creating and enforcing regulations around e-waste management, setting standards for product design and disposal, and investing in infrastructure for collection and recycling
- Manufacturers have a responsibility to design products that are more durable, repairable, and recyclable, and to take back and properly dispose of their products at the end of their useful life
- Consumers have a responsibility to make informed purchasing decisions, to properly maintain and repair their devices, and to dispose of them responsibly when they are no longer needed
- All three groups need to work together to create a more sustainable system for managing e-waste, through a combination of regulations, incentives, education, and voluntary initiatives
- To ensure that e-waste is disposed of responsibly and sustainably, we need to invest in safe and efficient recycling infrastructure, promote the recovery and reuse of valuable materials, and minimize the export of e-waste to countries with weaker environmental and labor standards
