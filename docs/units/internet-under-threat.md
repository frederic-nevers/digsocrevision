# üåê The Internet is under threat üîí

This unit explores the concept of net neutrality, its importance, and the various threats to the open nature of the Internet. Students will also learn about different types of cybercrime and the ethical considerations surrounding the fight against cybercrime.

## üåü The Big Ideas üåü

- **Open Network**: Understanding how the Internet was built as a completely open network, where each data packet was treated the same as any other, with complete disregard for security.
- **Transformation of Society**: Recognizing how the openness of the Internet has led to a transformation of society.
- **Threats to Net Neutrality**: Analyzing the concept that each data packet should be treated the same and how it is under threat in many parts of the world.
- **Cybercrime**: Examining how criminals have found multiple ways to use the network's (and people's!) vulnerabilities to profit and what can be done about it.

## ‚ùì Inquiry Questions ‚ùì

### Content-based
<details>
<summary>üåê What is net neutrality and why is it important?</summary>

- Net neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should treat all internet traffic equally, without discriminating or charging differently based on content, user, platform, or application
- It ensures that all internet users have equal access to online content and services, and prevents ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing certain types of traffic
- Net neutrality is important for maintaining an open, free, and innovative internet, where everyone has the same opportunities to communicate, create, and compete online
- Without net neutrality, ISPs could create "fast lanes" for content providers who pay more, disadvantaging smaller or newer players and limiting consumer choice and access to information

</details>

<details>
<summary>‚öñÔ∏è What are the arguments for and against net neutrality?</summary>

Arguments for net neutrality:
- It ensures equal access to online content and services, promoting freedom of speech, innovation, and competition
- It prevents ISPs from discriminating against or censoring certain types of content or applications
- It protects consumers from having to pay more for access to certain websites or services
- It ensures that the internet remains a level playing field for all users, regardless of their size, resources, or popularity

Arguments against net neutrality:
- It may discourage ISPs from investing in network infrastructure and innovation, as they cannot charge more for premium services
- It may lead to network congestion and slower speeds for everyone, as ISPs cannot prioritize traffic based on demand or importance
- It may limit the ability of ISPs to offer customized or specialized services that some consumers may want or need
- It may stifle business models that rely on paid prioritization, such as telemedicine, online gaming, or streaming services

</details>

<details>
<summary>ü§ù How does net neutrality impact internet service providers and consumers?</summary>

Impact on ISPs:
- Net neutrality rules prevent ISPs from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing certain types of internet traffic, limiting their ability to manage their networks and offer differentiated services
- ISPs may have less incentive to invest in network infrastructure and innovation, as they cannot charge more for premium services or prioritize traffic based on demand or importance
- ISPs may face increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs, as they must ensure that their practices align with net neutrality principles and rules

Impact on consumers:
- Net neutrality ensures that consumers have equal access to online content and services, without having to pay more for certain websites or applications
- Consumers may benefit from increased competition and innovation in the online marketplace, as smaller or newer players have the same opportunities to reach audiences and offer services
- Consumers may experience slower speeds or network congestion, as ISPs cannot prioritize traffic based on demand or importance
- Consumers may have fewer choices for customized or specialized services, as ISPs may be less likely to offer them under net neutrality rules

<summary>üïµÔ∏è What are the different types of cybercrime, and how do they differ from traditional forms of crime?</summary>

Types of cybercrime:
- Hacking: Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks, often with the intent to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations
- Malware: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, such as viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware
- Phishing: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data, by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication
- Identity theft: The unauthorized use of someone else's personal information, such as name, social security number, or credit card details, to commit fraud or other crimes
- Cyberbullying: The use of electronic communication to bully, harass, or intimidate someone, often anonymously or repeatedly

Differences from traditional crime:
- Cybercrime is committed using computer systems and networks, while traditional crime involves physical acts or interactions
- Cybercrime can be committed remotely and anonymously, making it harder to detect, investigate, and prosecute than traditional crime
- Cybercrime can have a much wider reach and impact than traditional crime, as it can target victims across borders and jurisdictions
- Cybercrime often involves the theft or manipulation of digital data, while traditional crime typically involves physical property or assets
- Cybercrime requires a different set of skills, tools, and knowledge than traditional crime, such as hacking, programming, and social engineering

<summary>üíª How does cybercrime impact individuals, businesses, and society as a whole?</summary>

Impact on individuals:
- Cybercrime can result in financial losses, such as theft of money or personal information, or costs associated with resolving the crime
- It can cause emotional distress, such as fear, anxiety, or embarrassment, especially in cases of cyberbullying or identity theft
- It can lead to a loss of privacy and control over personal data, as well as a sense of vulnerability and mistrust in online interactions

Impact on businesses:
- Cybercrime can disrupt business operations, causing downtime, lost productivity, and reputational damage
- It can result in financial losses, such as theft of intellectual property, customer data, or funds, as well as costs associated with remediation and legal action
- It can lead to a loss of customer trust and loyalty, as well as increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements

Impact on society:
- Cybercrime can undermine the security and stability of critical infrastructure, such as energy grids, transportation systems, and financial networks
- It can erode public trust in digital technologies and online interactions, hindering the adoption and benefits of the digital economy
- It can exacerbate social and economic inequalities, as some individuals and communities may be more vulnerable to cybercrime due to lack of awareness, resources, or protection
- It can strain law enforcement and judicial systems, as they struggle to keep pace with the scale, complexity, and transnational nature of cybercrime

### Conceptual
<details>
<summary>üí° How does net neutrality relate to free speech and the open exchange of ideas online?</summary>

- Net neutrality is closely tied to the principle of free speech, as it ensures that all individuals and groups have equal access to online platforms and audiences, regardless of their views or resources
- Without net neutrality, ISPs could censor or prioritize certain types of content based on their own interests or biases, limiting the diversity and openness of online discourse
- Net neutrality prevents the creation of "walled gardens" or "echo chambers", where individuals are exposed only to information and perspectives that align with their own beliefs
- By ensuring equal treatment of all internet traffic, net neutrality enables the free flow of information and ideas across borders and communities, facilitating global communication and collaboration

</details>

### Debatable
<details>
<summary>üîÆ What is the future of net neutrality, and how might it evolve in response to changing technology and political pressures?</summary>

- The future of net neutrality is uncertain and contested, as different stakeholders have competing interests and visions for the internet
- Advances in network technologies, such as 5G and edge computing, may challenge the traditional assumptions and principles of net neutrality, as they enable new types of services and applications with different requirements and characteristics
- The increasing dominance of a few large tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, may shift the focus of net neutrality debates from ISPs to content and platform providers, who have significant control over online information and interactions
- The political landscape and regulatory approaches to net neutrality may vary across countries and regions, reflecting different cultural, economic, and social contexts and priorities
- The ongoing debates and developments around net neutrality will shape the future of the internet as a global public good, with profound implications for innovation, competition, and human rights
